# üîé ft_nmap

`ft_nmap` is a lightweight re-implementation of a portion of the original [nmap](https://nmap.org/) network scanner, developed in C. The goal of this project is to explore advanced socket programming, raw packet crafting, multithreading, and real-time packet capture using `libpcap`.

## About

This project is a simplified network port scanner built using:

- Raw TCP & UDP socket programming
- Threaded job queue system
- Real-time packet listening using [`libpcap`](https://www.tcpdump.org/)
- Custom implementation of `SYN`, `ACK`, `NULL`, `FIN`, `XMAS`, and `UDP` scan techniques

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is for educational purposes only. Do not use on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to scan.

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ Command-line argument parser
- ‚úÖ Multi-threaded port scanning (`--speedup`)
- ‚úÖ Support for scanning ranges (`--ports 20-80`)
- ‚úÖ Custom scan types: `--scan SYN,ACK,NULL,FIN,XMAS,UDP`
- ‚úÖ Live packet capture with `libpcap`
- ‚úÖ Clear and categorized scan result output
- ‚úÖ Dynamic job queue with producer-consumer logic

## Job Queue System

### [Overview](#overview)

The **job queue** (`t_job_queue`) is a central mechanism in `ft_nmap` that manages the distribution of scanning tasks across multiple threads. It is designed to be **thread-safe and efficient**, ensuring maximum concurrency while maintaining correctness.

---

### [Why a Job Queue?](#why-a-job-queue)

In a multi-threaded port scanner, it's essential to manage tasks (port scans) efficiently across worker threads. Without a job queue, threads might:

- Compete for shared resources,
- Miss tasks (or duplicate them),
- Suffer from performance issues due to contention.

The job queue enables **producer-consumer synchronization** and ensures that:

- Each job is executed exactly once,
- No two threads scan the same port/type combination,
- The main thread prepares jobs,
- Worker threads focus purely on sending packets.

---

### [How It Works](#how-it-works)

#### Example

If the user provides:
- Ports: `22`, `80`
- Scan Types: `SYN`, `UDP`

Then the following jobs will be generated and added to the job queue:

| Target IP | Port | Scan Type |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| x.x.x.x   | 22   | SYN       |
| x.x.x.x   | 22   | UDP       |
| x.x.x.x   | 80   | SYN       |
| x.x.x.x   | 80   | UDP       |

This matrix-like expansion ensures that **every specified port is scanned with every specified scan type**.
